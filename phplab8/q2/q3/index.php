<!-- On a movie web page we would like to select a movie category from a dropdown list. 
However, the backend system needs not the text of the category but its identifier value. 
Eg 5 - Action, 4 - Drama, 8 - Comedy. Find out the data structure, 
and then generate the dropdown list based on this data structure! -->
